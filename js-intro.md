# ASSESSMENT 1: INTRO TO JAVASCRIPT
## Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.   

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A function is a set group of code that runs with its own rules. You would create a function to run code according to the set rules of the function.

  Researched answer: A function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. We can use the instructions to build something over and over again, in the same way that one blueprint can be used many times to build many buildings.


2. What is a method?

  Your answer: Methods are certain actions that are being done within the code.

  Researched answer: JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects.


3. List 5 examples of JavaScript string methods.

  Your answer: .length, .search, .concat, .split, .toLowerCase

  Researched answer: .toString, .toUpperCase, .charAt, .indexOf, .lastIndexOf 


4. List 5 examples of JavaScript array methods.

  Your answer: pop, push, join, concat, sort

  Researched answer: splice, slice, split, shift, unshift, 


5. Explain the difference between accessor and mutator methods. Provide an example of each.

  Your answer: Accessors are getters and mutators are setters.

  Researched answer: Accessor are methods that access an array and does not change the array (concat, join, indexOf). Mutators are methods that change the original array (push, pop, shift).


6. Explain the difference between console.log() and return.

  Your answer: There can be an unlimited amount of logs, but each function can only have 1 return.

  Researched answer: You can call console.log as many times as we want and we can even call console.log inside functions but we can only have 1 return in a function.


7. In regards to functions, what is an argument? What is the difference between an argument and a variable?

  Your answer: functions need an argument ex: function example(arguement). Variables store information var example = variable.

  Researched answer: Arguements are pieces of outside information that is used when a function runs. Variables must be declared and assigned a value using a single equals sign.


8. Give a brief description of JavaScript as if you were explaining it to someone who doesn't know anything about programming.

  Your answer:  JavaScript makes the page dynamic.

  Researched answer: JavaScript is a versatile and powerful scripting language used to make a webpage dynamic.


9. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the rolls of each person?

  Your answer: Some proper pair programming techniques are switching roles frequently and actively communicating with eachother. The driver is the person that is typing out the code and the navigator observes and helps guide the driver as they type.
  
  Researched answer: Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the navigator reviews each line of code as it is typed in and comes up with ideas for improvements and likely future problems to address.
